# Higher

## Introduction
Higher is a digital playing card game that pits the player against a computer opponent. The main goal of the game is to select cards with a number value high enough that
when added to the score counter in the middle, will surpass the opponent's total score counter. The player and computer trade blows by picking valid cards until either one
of them runs out of cards or no longer has any valid cards in play. This game was heavily-inspired by the playing card minigame "Blade" from Nihon Falcom's "Trails of Cold Steel"
series.

## Types of Cards
There are 3 main types of cards: Planet, Sun, and Wormhole. 

### Planet Cards
Planet cards are the standard value cards with no intrinsic special ability (except for the Pluto card) modelled after the 9 original planets of our solar system.
Pluto holds the smallest value in the game being only worth 1 point while Jupiter holds the highest point value boasting 9 points! These cards are the main stay of your
celestial deck and will help push your score Higher and (hopefully) above the opponent's. 

### Sun Card
Sun cards are a special type of card that will turn over the most-recently played card by your opponent, removing that card's value from the opponent's score total. The
opponent has 1 chance to revive the turned-down card with a Pluto card if they have one. However, if they play a regular planet or wormhole card instead, the turned-down
card is now lost forever.

### Wormhole Card
Wormhole cards are a special type of card that will switch both the player and computer's scores. This card is particularly devastating when the opponent has a high point lead. 
Be aware, however, that the opponent can also reply with a Wormhole of their own, switching the scores right back!
